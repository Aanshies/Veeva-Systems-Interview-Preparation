Both of these users should be able to register an account. 
// Any user who is less than 12 years of age will be registered as a child and they can borrow a “Kids” category book for 10 days, whereas an adult can borrow “Fiction” category books which need to be returned within 7 days. 
// Note: In future, more users/roles might be added to the library where similar rules will be enforced.
// Develop Interfaces and classes for the categories mentioned above.
// • Create an interface LibraryUser with the following methods
// void registerAccount()
// void requestBook()
// • Create 2 classes “KidUsers” and “AdultUser” which implements the
// LibraryUser interface. Both the classes should have two instance variables -
// age(int),bookType(String)
// • The methods in the KidUser class should perform the following logic.
// registerAccount():
// • if age < 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under a Kids
// Account” should be displayed in the console.
// • If(age>12), a message displaying, “Sorry, Age must be less than 12 to register
// as a kid” should be displayed in the console.
// requestBook():
// • if bookType is “Kids”, a message displaying “Book Issued successfully, please
// return the book within 10 days” should be displayed in the console,else, a
// message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only kids books” should be
// displayed in the console.
// • The methods in the AdultUser class should perform the following logic.
// registerAccount():
// • if age > 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under an
// Adult Account” should be displayed in the console.
// • If age<12, a message displaying, “Sorry, Age must be greater than 12 to register
// as an adult” should be displayed in the console.
// requestBook():
// • if bookType is “Fiction”, a message displaying “Book Issued successfully, please
// return the book within 7 days” should be displayed in the console., else, a
// message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only adult Fiction books”
// should be displayed in the console.
// • Create a class “LibraryInterfaceDemo.java” with a main method and test the
// functionalities by creating objects of KidUser and AdultUser classes.
